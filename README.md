Many credit and debit card users do not take advantage of Rewards programs offered by their banks or financial institutions. The reason could be many:

Lack of awareness
Lack of interest
Difficulty in redeeming rewards
Lack of trust
Inadequate rewards
Inconsistent rewards
Cost of participation

Solution:
Reading such a long paras for understanding about the reward programs could be a tedious task.
According to the research 65% of people are enhancing opportunities through visual aids.
Visuals are a great way to understand things much more easier.
So we are creating a gamifying environment in which the user can understand the rewards through visual aids using their own  "AVATAR".
