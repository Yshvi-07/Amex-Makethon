Rewards gamification for credit or debit card transaction
Problem statement name

Develop a gamification strategic application that can help credit and debit card users take advantage of Rewards programs.

Overview

Many credit and debit card users do not take advantage of Rewards programs offered by their banks or financial institutions. This can be due to a lack of understanding of how the program works, a perception that the rewards are not significant enough to make a difference, or a lack of engagement with the program.

The challenge is to design a gamification strategic application that is effective in engaging users and driving desired behaviors, such as using the card for specific transactions or spending a certain amount each month. The strategy must also be easy to understand and use and be scalable across different user segments and markets.
