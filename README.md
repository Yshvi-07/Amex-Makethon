Many credit and debit card users do not take advantage of Rewards programs offered by their banks or financial institutions. 
This can be due to a lack of understanding of how the program works, a perception that the rewards are not significant enough to make a difference, or a lack of engagement with the program.

The challenge is to design a gamification strategic application that is effective in engaging users and driving desired behaviors, such as using the card for specific transactions or spending a certain amount each month. The strategy must also be easy to understand and use and be scalable across different user segments and markets.

Solution:
Reading such a long paras for understanding about the reward programs could be a tedious task.
According to the research 65% of people are enhancing opportunities through visual aids.
Visuals are a great way to understand things much more easier.
So we are creating a gamifying environment in which the user can understand the rewards through visual aids using their own  "AVATAR".
